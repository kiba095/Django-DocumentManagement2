# Django-DocumentManagement2
 phase2 of document management (March 16-30)

The principal is member of the commitee so he/she has two accounts
	
	user: com1 (the uploader) -> School Head
	pass: demo1234

	user: principal (the approver)
	pass: demo1234

The Members of the Commitee will have only one account (uploaders)

	user:	pass:
	com2	demo1234 -> Leadership
	com3	demo1234 -> Internal Stakeholders
	com4	demo1234 -> External Stakeholders
	com5	demo1234 -> School Improvement Resources
	com6	demo1234 -> School-Based Resources
